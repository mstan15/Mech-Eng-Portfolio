# Mech-Eng-Portfolio
Mitchell Stankey's body of work as a mechanical engineer.  This README contains a brief and general overview of my mechanical and systems design experience.  More detailed presentations of my work are included in this repository.

PCB/CCA Design: 
  1. Defined the following to satisfy mechanical constraints:
     - Overall circuit board size and thickness
     - PCB header locations
     - Tooling and mounting hole placement
     - Keep-in and keep-out zones
     - Height restrictions
  2. Defined the following to satisfy IEC 61010 constraints to protect against electrical shock:
     - Minimum creepage and clearance distances required from high voltage (HV) components (1500 VDC) to ground
     - PCB Laminate, pre-preg, silkscreen, and soldermask selection to maintain CTI > 600 material group spacing for HV  components
  3. Defined the following to satisfy safety and compliance constraints:
     - Product Markings: CE, ROHS, Hazardous Voltage, Symbol 14

Cable Harness Design: 
  1. Defined the following to satisfy mechanical constraints:
  2. Defined the following to satisfy electrical constraints:
     -
